                            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots 
                            in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
                            Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked 
                            up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
                            going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
                            source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
                            Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
                            treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line
                            of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
